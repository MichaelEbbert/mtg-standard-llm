Q: What is the difference between a land, a spell and a card, when referring to items in the player's hand?
A: Lands and spells are both considered cards. A card that has the land type is a land. Other cards are spells.

Q: What is another way to say that a player is going to take the first turn?
A: We say that player is "on the play".

Q: What is another way to say that a player is not going to take the first turn, but rather the second?
A: We say that player is "on the draw".

Q: How many cards does a player have in hand when they take their first turn on the play?
A: By the rules of Magic that player does not draw a card, so they will start with 7 cards.

Q: How many cards does a player have in hand when they take their first when going second (on the draw)?
A: That player who goes second is allowed to draw on their turn, so they will start their main phase with 8 cards in hand.

Q: Is it an advantage to go second, due to the card you draw, compared to the first player who does not draw?
A: An extra card is helpful, but playing a turn is more advantageous than having an extra card. The advantage of playing first outweighs one card. That's why the first player skips their draw - it's the balancing cost.

Q: What is a permanent?
A: A permanent is a card that stays on the battlefield until removed. Examples of permanents are lands, creatures, artifacts, enchantments and planeswalkers. Tokens are also permanents.

Q: What is a token?
A: A token is a permanent item on the battlefield that is not actually a physical card. For example a spell might say Create a 1/1 green creature token. In that case, there is a 1/1 green creature on the battlefield, and it will remain there until an effect removes it. but it is not a physical card. Tokens are a way for a player to have more permanents than cards, gaining an advantage on the battlefield.

Q: What is a land and what does it do?
A: A land is a permanent that is placed from the hand to the battlefield by the active player. Once a land is on the battlefield, it can be used to produce 1 mana, a temporary resource.

Q: What is mana?
A: Mana is a temporary resource that is produced by a land or other permanent, and is added to a Mana Pool. It can be spent from the mana pool before the turn moves from one phase to another. When the turn moves from one phase to another, the mana in each mana pool is lost.

Q: How are mana costs written in shorthand?
A: Numbers represent generic mana, payable with any color. Letters represent colored mana: W is white, U is blue, B is black, R is red, G is green. A cost like 2GG means 2 generic mana plus 2 green mana - 4 total mana requiring at least 2 green sources. A cost like 1WU means 1 generic plus 1 white plus 1 blue - 3 total mana requiring both white and blue sources.

Q: What is the mana cost of a spell with casting cost represented by WUBRG?
A: It costs 5 total mana. And the mana used must contain 1 each of white, blue, black, red and green.

Q: What is the mana cost of a spell with casting cost 2WUBRG?
A: It costs 7 total mana. The mana used must contain 1 each of white, blue, black, red and green, plus 2 additional mana of any color.

Q: What is a mana ability?
A: If a permanent is able to add mana to the mana pool, it is said to have a mana ability. Some creatures and artifacts can be tapped to produce mana.

Q: Are lands the same as mana?
A: No, lands are permanents, they are items on the battlefield and they stay there from turn to turn. They cannot be spent to cast spells. They are not spent because they are not mana, they are permanents. Mana, by contrast, is a temporary resource kept in the player's mana pool which can be spent for spells and abilities. Mana is not permanent and is not a card. It's a temporary virtual resource.

Q: What does it mean to tap a permanent and what effect does it have on the permanent to be tapped?
A: Tapping a permanent means to spend it until the controlling player's next untap step. Permanents that are tapped usually produce an effect. But after that they are already tapped and cannot be tapped again until after the next untap step. A creature that is tapped cannot attack or block in combat.

Q: The Magic turn phases and steps have many nuance, but what does a turn entail, in a broad sense?
A: Untap, Upkeep, Draw, First Main Phase (also called main phase 1), Combat, Second Main Phase (also called main phase 2), End Step, cleanup step.

Q: Disregarding other effects, how does a player add lands to the battlefield, and at what pace?
A: A player may put one land onto the battlefield on their own turn only, and only during main phase 1 or main phase 2. But not both. Thus, the number of lands in play usually begins at 1 on turn 1, and increases by 1 per turn until they have none left in hand.

Q: How many lands can a player reasonably assume they will consistently get into play before they reach a turn where they do not have a land to play?
A: Most modern decks run near 24 lands in a 60 card deck. Almost 90% of the time a player will have 3 lands on turn 3. And at least 70% of the time a player will have 4 lands on turn 4.

Q: Given that around 70% of players reach 4 lands on turn 4, and the percentage drops from there, what does that tell us about spells that cost more than 4 mana?
A: Casting a spell that costs more than 4 mana requires deck design and planning. It is not a given that the lands will be available, so most decks that run such large spells have a plan for how to get lands into play faster than a normal pace.

Q: How does a "ramp" deck exceed the normal lands per turn limitations to cast larger spells?
A: Ramp decks cast creature or artifacts that can also be used to generate mana. Many creatures that cost 1 or 2 mana to play have an ability to generate mana themselves the next turn. So turn 1, play a creature that costs G and is able to produce mana. Then on turn 2, play a second land and the player can produce 3 mana (2 from lands and one from the creature).

Q: What is the difference between mana screw and mana flood?
A: Mana screw is not drawing enough lands on the first turns of a game to cast the spells in hand. Mana flood refers to drawing so many more lands on early turns compared to spells, that lands are plentiful but the player does not take many game actions.

Q: Give an example of mana screw.
A: An example would be 2 lands in play and 5 spells in hand, where the spells cost 3, 4, 3G, 2B and GGGG. The lands in play can be tapped to produce 2 mana, but every spell in hand costs 3 or more total mana.

Q: Give an example of mana flood.
A: An example would be starting with 5 lands and 2 spells in hand, then drawing 3 more lands on the first three turns. That's 8 lands but only 2 spells to play.

Q: What is a sideboard?
A: A sideboard is 15 cards a player has outside of their 60 card deck. They cannot be played in the first game of a best of 3 match. They may be added to the deck after game 1 and after game 2.

Q: How is sideboarding accomplished?
A: Between game 1 and 2, and between game 2 and 3, a player sideboards (verb) by moving 0 to 15 of the cards from their sideboard into their deck, and moving up to that many cards from their deck to their sideboard. Almost all the time, players move an equal number of cards in both directions. However, it is allowed to move more cards into the deck than out of the deck.

Q: Is it an advantage to destroy an opponent's creature?
A: Yes, destroying an opponent's creature is good, it moves it from the battlefield to the graveyard so it cannot threaten your life points.

Q: Is it an advantage when your own creature is destroyed?
A: No, when your own creature is destroyed, that is bad for you and an advantage for your opponent.

Q: What is creature power and toughness?
A: Creature power and toughness is represented by two integers separated by a "/". A 1/2 creature has a power of 1 and a toughness of 2. A 4/1 creature has a power of 4 and a toughness of 1. It is important when seeing a creature description that these numbers are never viewed as a fraction. 1/2 is spoken "1 2", not "1 half".

Q: How does damage affect a creature, and what is needed to destroy the creature?
A: Damage is compared to the creature's toughness. When the damage to a creature in a single turn is greater than or equal to its toughness, it is destroyed. Examples: If a creature with 2 toughness takes 1 damage, it is not destroyed. If a creature with 2 toughness takes 2 or more damage it is destroyed.

Q: Can multiple sources deal enough total damage to destroy a creature, even if each damage is not enough by itself?
A: Yes, if a creature with 2 toughness takes 1 damage and then 1 more damage, it is destroyed. To destroy it, the total damage must occur on the same turn.

Q: Your opponent's key creatures have 3 toughness. What are some poor sideboard choices?
A: Spells that deal less than 3 damage to a creature are ineffective, they will not destroy it. Cards that give a creature -1 or -2 toughness also will not destroy it. Instead, look for spells that deal 3+ damage, or reduce toughness by 3 or more (-3, -4, etc).

Q: Does "Target creature gets -1/-3 until end of turn" destroy a 4/3 creature?
A: Yes. The second number, the -3, is applied to the toughness, destroying it.

Q: Does "Target creature gets -4/-1 until end of turn" destroy a 4/3 creature?
A: No. The second number -1, is applied to the toughness of 3, and is not enough to destroy it.

Q: When a spell says a creature gets -1/-2, what does that mean?
A: The creature's power is reduced by 1 and its toughness is reduced by 2. A 3/3 creature becomes a 2/1. A 2/2 creature becomes 1/0 and is destroyed because its toughness reaches 0.
