## Evergreen Keywords

### Deathtouch
**Rules**: Any amount of damage this deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.
**Strategy**: Deathtouch applies whenever the creature deals damage to another creature - including Fight effects and direct damage, not just combat. When blocked by multiple creatures, the deathtouch creature can assign just 1 damage to each, destroying them all (a 3/3 deathtouch blocked by three 5/5s kills all three). Synergizes powerfully with First Strike/Double Strike, killing blockers before they deal damage back. With Flying, opponents can't evade it. On defense, deathtouch blockers dissuade aggro from attacking. On offense, opponents often let damage through rather than lose valuable creatures to a trade. Granting deathtouch at instant speed during combat creates blowouts. Trample with Deathtouch is useful because after dealing 1 damage to each blocker, the rest of the attacking creature's power is dealt to the opponent. When playing with a deathtouch creature, controller attempts to trade up. For example, trading a 1/1 deathtouch creature for a 5/5 opponent's creature. When playing against Deathtouch, try to kill the creature outside of combat with spells, or use an indestructible creature, or evade the deathtouch creature by using abilities like flying or menace.

### Defender
**Rules**: This creature can't attack.
**Strategy**: Creatures with Defender often have higher stats for their mana cost, or useful tap abilities. Some have abilities that remove Defender, turning them into powerful attackers. When playing Defenders, ensure they provide value beyond blocking - through abilities or as a wall opponents won't attack into. When playing against them, you can be more aggressive since they can't attack you. Removal on Defenders is lower priority - save it for threats that pressure your life total. In combat, evaluate them like any other blocker.

### Double Strike
**Rules**: This creature deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.
**Strategy**: Double strike effectively doubles a creature's combat damage output. A 3/3 double strike deals 6 damage to a player. Pump spells are twice as effective - Giant Growth on a 2/2 double strike adds 6 damage, not 3. Combines devastatingly with deathtouch (kills in first strike, still deals regular damage), lifelink (gain life twice), and trample (first strike damage kills blockers, regular damage tramples through). When playing with double strike, prioritize pump spells and equipment - the damage multiplication makes them extremely efficient. When playing against double strike, remove it before combat or chump block to prevent the damage. Don't let pump spells resolve on an unblocked double striker.

### Enchant
**Rules**: Defines what an Aura can be attached to.
**Strategy**: Auras carry inherent risk - if the enchanted permanent is removed, you lose both cards (a two-for-one against yourself). Mitigate this by enchanting hexproof creatures (safe from targeted removal), getting immediate value from ETB effects, or using cheap auras where the tempo gained outweighs the risk. When playing against auras, removing the creature in response to the aura is a blowout. Prioritize removal on enchanted creatures since you're trading one card for two.

### Equip
**Rules**: Attach this Equipment to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.
**Strategy**: Unlike auras, equipment survives when the creature dies - you can re-equip to another creature. This resilience makes equipment better in grindy games. The weakness is sorcery-speed equipping: you can't surprise opponents in combat, and they can remove the creature in response to equip. Equipment is best on creatures with evasion (flying, trample) or protection. When playing against equipment, kill creatures in response to equip to waste their mana. Consider artifact removal if the equipment provides significant value.

### First Strike
**Rules**: This creature deals combat damage before creatures without first strike.
**Strategy**: First strike lets you kill opposing creatures before they deal damage back. A 3/3 first strike beats a 3/3 without it - yours deals 3 damage first, theirs dies before dealing damage. This makes first strike creatures excellent at attacking into similar-sized blockers. Combines well with deathtouch (kill anything before it damages you) and pump spells (surprise kills in the first strike step). When playing against first strike, use larger creatures that survive the first strike damage, removal spells, or your own first strikers. Double blocking can work but you'll lose the first blocker.

### Flash
**Rules**: You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.
**Strategy**: Flash provides information advantage - you see what opponent does before committing. Cast creatures at end of opponent's turn to have mana open for interaction during their turn, then untap with a threat ready to attack. Flash creatures double as surprise blockers, ambushing attackers. Flash enables bluffs - holding mana up could be counterspells, removal, or a flash creature. When playing against flash, expect surprise blockers when attacking into open mana. Force them to use flash early by applying pressure.

### Flying
**Rules**: This creature can't be blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.
**Strategy**: Flying is the most common form of evasion. Flyers often win races because they deal damage while ground creatures stare at each other. In limited especially, flying is premium - unblockable damage wins games. Build decks with either enough flyers to race, or enough reach/removal to handle opposing flyers. When playing with flyers, prioritize attacking - that's their purpose. When playing against flyers, save removal for them if you lack flying/reach blockers. Racing on the ground is possible but requires significant damage advantage.

### Haste
**Rules**: This creature can attack and tap as soon as it comes under your control.
**Strategy**: Haste eliminates the "summoning sickness" turn where creatures are vulnerable but can't act. This provides surprise damage opponents couldn't plan for, and guarantees at least one attack before removal can be used (during their turn). Haste creatures are excellent topdecks when racing and make pump spells more threatening. When evaluating haste creatures, add one attack worth of damage to their value. When playing against haste, keep blockers available even against an empty board. Expect damage from nowhere when opponent has mana up.

### Hexproof
**Rules**: This permanent can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.
**Strategy**: Hexproof shuts down targeted removal entirely - Murder, burn spells, bounce all fail. This makes hexproof creatures excellent aura carriers (no two-for-one risk) and resilient threats that demand specific answers. Beating hexproof requires: board sweepers (Wrath effects don't target), edict effects (opponent sacrifices, no targeting), -X/-X effects if they don't target, or simply racing. When playing hexproof, load it up with auras/equipment. When playing against hexproof, don't hold targeted removal hoping to use it - find alternate answers or race.

### Indestructible
**Rules**: Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy this permanent.
**Strategy**: Indestructible survives damage (including deathtouch) and destroy effects (Murder, Wrath). It doesn't prevent: exile effects, sacrifice effects, -X/-X effects (reducing toughness to 0), or "return to hand" effects. When playing indestructible creatures, attack and block freely into anything - you'll survive. Watch for exile-based removal. When playing against indestructible, save exile effects for these threats. Edict effects (opponent sacrifices) work if you can clear other creatures first. Bounce is temporary but resets any counters/auras.

### Lifelink
**Rules**: Damage dealt by this creature also causes you to gain that much life.
**Strategy**: Lifelink swings damage races by effectively dealing double the life difference - a 3/3 lifelink attacking makes the life differential change by 6 (you gain 3, they lose 3). Larger lifelink creatures are disproportionately better because the life swing scales. Combines well with deathtouch (trade up and gain life), double strike (gain life twice), and trample (damage to player gains life). When playing lifelink, prioritize attacking - blocking only prevents damage, attacking gains life. When playing against lifelink, chump blocking prevents the life gain. Remove lifelink creatures before damage is dealt.

### Menace
**Rules**: This creature can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.
**Strategy**: Menace forces awkward blocking decisions. Against a single blocker, menace is unblockable. Against two blockers, they're committing both to stop one threat. This makes menace excellent when opponents have few creatures or valuable creatures they don't want to double-block with. Combining menace with high power or abilities like deathtouch makes double-blocking even worse. When playing menace, attack when opponent has limited blockers - force damage through. When playing against menace, keep two expendable blockers ready, or use removal instead of blocking.

### Protection
**Rules**: Protection from [quality] means: can't be blocked by, targeted by, dealt damage by, or enchanted/equipped by sources with that quality.
**Strategy**: Protection provides near-immunity to a color or type. Remember "DEBT": Damage prevented, Enchant/Equip prevented, Blocking prevented, Targeting prevented. Protection from a color makes a creature unblockable against that color, immune to their removal, and prevents combat damage. It's matchup-dependent: protection from red dominates mono-red, but does nothing against green creatures. When playing protection, position it as an unblockable finisher against the relevant colors. When playing against protection, use colorless removal, sacrifice effects, or board sweepers (protection doesn't prevent "destroy all").

### Reach
**Rules**: This creature can block creatures with flying.
**Strategy**: Reach is defensive - it doesn't grant flying, just lets you block flyers. Green gets reach instead of flying, enabling ground creatures to answer aerial threats. Reach creatures are often larger for their cost since the ability is narrow. When building decks, include reach creatures if you lack flyers and your meta has flying threats. When playing with reach, keep these creatures back specifically to block flyers rather than trading them in ground combat. When playing against reach, your flyers are no longer evasive against these blockers - evaluate combat normally.

### Trample
**Rules**: This creature can deal excess combat damage to the defending player or planeswalker.
**Strategy**: Trample ensures big creatures deal damage even when blocked by small creatures. A 6/6 trample blocked by a 2/2 still deals 4 damage to the player. This makes chump blocking ineffective and rewards pump spells (all the extra power tramples through). Combines devastatingly with deathtouch - assign just 1 damage to each blocker (lethal with deathtouch), trample the rest. When playing trample, attack freely into small blockers, and prioritize pump spells. When playing against trample, you need creatures big enough to actually stop the damage, not just chump blockers. Removal is often better than blocking.

### Vigilance
**Rules**: Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap.
**Strategy**: Vigilance lets you attack without defensive cost - you can still block next turn. This is excellent on larger creatures that dominate both offense and defense. Vigilance creatures pressure opponents while holding back aggression, perfect for midrange strategies that want board control. There's no decision between "attack or hold back" - you do both. When playing vigilance, attack more freely since you're not exposing yourself. When playing against vigilance, you can't race by attacking when they're tapped out - they're never tapped out. Focus on removal rather than trying to sneak damage through.

### Ward
**Rules**: Whenever this permanent becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter it unless that player pays the ward cost.
**Strategy**: Ward is a softer hexproof - opponents can still target it, but must pay extra. Ward taxes their mana, potentially preventing them from double-spelling or forcing them to wait a turn. Ward X is stronger than it looks when X is 2+. Unlike hexproof, ward doesn't stop abilities that don't target or board sweepers. When playing with ward, recognize it buys time, not immunity - eventually they'll pay the cost. When playing against ward, factor the ward cost into your removal timing. Sometimes it's correct to wait until you have extra mana rather than waste a removal spell.

## Bending Abilities (Avatar: The Last Airbender set)

### Firebending
**Rules**: "Firebending N" means "Whenever this creature attacks, add N {R}. Until end of combat, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end."
**Strategy**: Firebending generates mana during combat, enabling explosive multi-spell turns. A firebending creature attacks, generates red mana, and you spend it on combat tricks, burn spells, or additional creatures before damage. This powers aggressive red strategies with turn-3 kills when combined with prowess and cheap spells. The mana is combat-only - use it or lose it after combat ends. When playing firebending, sequence spells after declaring attackers to access the mana. Build with cheap instants to maximize the generated mana. When playing against firebending, instant-speed removal before they untap denies them the attack trigger. Expect combat tricks if they attack with mana "available."

### Waterbend / Waterbending
**Rules**: Like Convoke - tap creatures and/or artifacts to help pay costs. Converts board presence into flexible payment currency.
**Strategy**: Waterbending converts your board into mana for specific effects. Unlike convoke which reduces mana costs, waterbending often pays for abilities like bouncing permanents or protecting creatures. It rewards going wide with tokens or cheap permanents. Key applications: protect your board from sweepers by bouncing your own creatures, re-trigger ETB effects for value, or surprise the opponent with effects they didn't think you could afford. When playing waterbending, build boards with disposable tappers (tokens, mana creatures). When playing against it, expect instant-speed tricks when they have untapped creatures/artifacts, even without mana available.

### Airbend
**Rules**: Delay-based exile effect - temporarily removes a spell or permanent, creating timing disruption. Target returns later.
**Strategy**: Airbend doesn't permanently answer threats - it delays them. This creates tempo advantage and timing disruption. Use it to: buy a crucial turn against a threat, re-trigger your own ETB effects, save your permanents from removal (exile in response, it returns after removal fizzles), or disrupt opponent's sequencing. The delay taxes their mana since they must recast or wait. When playing airbend, use it as a tempo tool in midrange/control, not as real removal. When playing against airbend, expect your spells to be delayed. Decide whether to recast immediately (tempo loss) or accept the delay. Plan sequencing around the return timing.

### Earthbend
**Rules**: Animates a land into a creature. When the animated land dies or is exiled, it returns to the battlefield tapped as a land (no permanent mana loss).
**Strategy**: Earthbend removes the traditional risk of land animation. Normally, if your animated land dies, you lose a land permanently. Earthbend lands return when killed - you only lose one turn of mana (enters tapped). This enables aggressive attacks with lands, sacrifice synergies using lands as fodder, and repeated reanimation loops. When playing earthbend, be aggressive with animated lands since the downside is minimal. Combine with sacrifice outlets for repeatable value. When playing against earthbend, killing the animated land doesn't set them back much. Focus on racing or handling the cards enabling earthbend rather than the lands themselves.

## Set-Specific Keywords (Standard Legal)

### Wilds of Eldraine

#### Bargain
**Rules**: You may sacrifice an artifact, enchantment, or token as you cast this spell.
**Strategy**: Bargain spells have a base effect plus a bonus if you sacrifice something. Build around it with disposable permanents: Food tokens, Treasure, creature tokens, or enchantments with ETB effects you've already gotten value from. Bargain adds value to otherwise useless permanents. When playing bargain, prioritize creating sacrifice fodder and time your bargain spells when you have appropriate sacrifices. When playing against bargain, removing their sacrifice fodder before they can bargain reduces the spell's value. Artifact/enchantment removal can deny bargain fuel.

#### Role Tokens
**Rules**: Aura tokens that attach to creatures (Cursed, Monster, Royal, Sorcerer, Wicked, Young Hero).
**Strategy**: Roles are aura tokens with different effects - Cursed weakens, Monster gives trample, Royal gives ward, etc. Key rule: a creature can only have one role from each player - assigning a new role removes the old one. This lets you upgrade roles as the game progresses or remove bad roles from your creatures by replacing them. When playing roles, remember you can overwrite your own roles. Cursed role on opponent's creatures is removal-lite. When playing against roles, the one-role limit means their buffed creature loses the buff if they assign a different role.

### The Lost Caverns of Ixalan

#### Craft
**Rules**: Exile this permanent and other materials to transform it into its crafted side.
**Strategy**: Craft transforms permanents into more powerful versions by exiling materials (usually from your graveyard or battlefield). This is a late-game mana sink that upgrades your cards. The crafted side is typically significantly stronger than the original. When playing craft, stock your graveyard and save mana for crafting in longer games. The original permanent gives value, then upgrades. When playing against craft, graveyard hate disrupts their crafting materials. Apply pressure to prevent them reaching the mana needed to craft.

#### Descend / Descended
**Rules**: Checks if a permanent card was put into your graveyard this turn, or counts permanent cards in graveyard.
**Strategy**: Descended triggers when permanents hit your graveyard - from dying creatures, sacrificed artifacts, milled cards, or discarded permanents. Descend 4/8 count permanent cards in graveyard for scaling bonuses. Build around it with self-mill, sacrifice effects, fetchlands (put land in graveyard), and cheap permanents to trade. When playing descended, ensure reliable ways to put permanents in graveyard each turn. When playing against descended, graveyard hate disrupts the count. Exiling their graveyard can turn off descend bonuses unexpectedly.

#### Discover
**Rules**: Exile cards from library until you exile a nonland with lower mana value. Cast it free or put to hand.
**Strategy**: Discover is Cascade's cousin - you get a free spell with lower mana value. Unlike cascade, you can choose to put it in hand instead of casting immediately. Build around it by controlling what you can hit: if your discover card costs 4, include powerful 3-or-less spells to find. Minimize low-value cheap cards that could be hit instead. When playing discover, sequence other spells first - you might discover something better to cast. When playing against discover, expect a free spell whenever they cast a discover card. Their deck construction tells you what they might hit.

#### Explore
**Rules**: Reveal top card. If land, put to hand. Otherwise +1/+1 counter on explorer, then may put card in graveyard.
**Strategy**: Explore smooths draws - find lands when you need them, grow your creature when you don't. If you reveal a nonland, you choose whether to keep it on top or put it in graveyard (fueling descended/delirium). Multiple explores dig through your deck rapidly. When playing explore, use it early to hit land drops, later to grow creatures and filter draws. Synergizes with +1/+1 counter themes and graveyard strategies. When playing against explore, their creatures grow larger than expected over time. Explore doesn't draw cards, so it's not card advantage - just selection.

#### Finality Counters
**Rules**: If a creature with a finality counter would die, exile it instead.
**Strategy**: Finality counters are often placed on creatures that return from the graveyard - giving them one more life but preventing further recursion. This is built-in graveyard hate against reanimation strategies. Creatures with finality counters can't be reanimated if killed. When playing with finality counters, your creature gets one more use but can't be recurred. When playing against finality counters, the creature only gets one death before it's gone forever - if you can force multiple deaths (bounce then kill, or copy effects), it exiles.

#### Map Tokens
**Rules**: Artifact token with "{1}, {T}, Sacrifice: Target creature you control explores."
**Strategy**: Map tokens provide repeatable explore effects as artifact tokens. They smooth draws, grow creatures, and fuel graveyard strategies. Being artifacts, they count for artifact synergies and can be sacrificed to other effects. When playing maps, use them when you have mana available - the explore is always valuable. Prioritize using them on creatures that benefit from +1/+1 counters. When playing against maps, artifact removal can deny the explore. Each map represents card selection and potential creature growth.

### Murders at Karlov Manor

#### Cloak
**Rules**: Put card face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature.
**Strategy**: Cloaked cards are 2/2 mystery creatures that can flip to their real form. Unlike morph, you turn them up by paying their normal mana cost, and you can do it at instant speed. This hides information and enables surprises - that 2/2 might be a huge threat. Noncreature cards stay face-down permanently. When playing cloak, attack with cloaked creatures to threaten flip-ups that could blow out blockers. When playing against cloaked creatures, you must guess what it might be. Killing it face-down denies them the creature's abilities.

#### Collect Evidence
**Rules**: Exile cards with total mana value N or more from your graveyard as additional cost.
**Strategy**: Collect evidence uses your graveyard as a resource. You exile cards totaling the required mana value to enable effects. This competes with other graveyard strategies (flashback, escape, descended) but rewards graveyard filling. High mana value cards in your graveyard make collecting evidence easier. When playing collect evidence, include ways to fill your graveyard (self-mill, cycling, trading creatures). When playing against it, graveyard hate denies them evidence. Exiling at instant speed in response to their spell can counter it if they can't pay the cost.

#### Disguise
**Rules**: Cast face down as 2/2 for {3}. Turn face up for disguise cost. Gains ward {2} while face down.
**Strategy**: Disguise is upgraded morph - face-down creatures have ward 2, making them harder to kill before flipping. Cast any disguise creature for 3 generic mana as a 2/2, then flip for the disguise cost to reveal it. The ward 2 protects your mystery creature while you build mana for the flip. When playing disguise, the ward makes face-down creatures reasonable to invest in. Flip at instant speed for combat tricks. When playing against disguise, the ward makes it costly to preemptively kill face-downs. Let them flip, then remove the creature if needed.

#### Suspect
**Rules**: Suspected creature has menace and can't block.
**Strategy**: Suspect is a double-edged status - menace helps attack, but the creature can't block. Use suspect on your creatures when racing, on opponent's creatures to deny blockers. Suspecting their best blocker opens attacks, suspecting your attacker pushes damage through. When playing suspect effects, evaluate whether menace or blocking matters more right now. Suspect your attackers when racing, their blockers when pressing advantage. When playing against suspect, having your blockers suspected is devastating - you can't defend. Suspect wears off if specified, or may be permanent.

### Outlaws of Thunder Junction

#### Commit a Crime
**Rules**: Targeting an opponent or their stuff, or causing them to discard.
**Strategy**: "Commit a crime" triggers whenever you target opponents or their permanents/cards, or make them discard. This rewards interactive play - removal spells, discard, targeted abilities all trigger crime bonuses. Build around it by including targeted interaction you'd run anyway. When playing crime triggers, recognize that your removal spells now provide bonus value. Prioritize targeting over non-targeting options when you have crime payoffs. When playing against crime decks, they're rewarded for interacting with you. You can't avoid being targeted, so instead pressure them to use interaction defensively rather than profitably.

#### Outlaw
**Rules**: Creature type batching: Assassin, Mercenary, Pirate, Rogue, or Warlock.
**Strategy**: Outlaw batches five creature types together for synergy purposes. Cards that say "outlaw" work with any of these types. This expands your options when building tribal-style decks - you're not locked to one type. When building outlaw decks, mix and match the best creatures from all five types. When playing against outlaws, recognize that their "tribal" payoffs have a wider pool of enablers than typical tribes.

#### Plot
**Rules**: Pay plot cost and exile. Cast later for free on your turn.
**Strategy**: Plot lets you pay now, cast free later. This banks mana from turns where you have excess and enables explosive future turns. A plotted card costs nothing to cast, so you can hold mana for interaction while still deploying threats. When playing plot, use it when you have extra mana with nothing better to do. Multiple plotted cards set up devastating turns. When playing against plot, track their exiled cards - those are coming. Apply pressure to force them to use resources before they can plot. Plotted cards are telegraphed threats.

#### Saddle
**Rules**: Tap creatures with total power N to make this Vehicle become a creature.
**Strategy**: Saddle is a vehicle variant - tap creatures with total power N to crew it. Unlike regular crew, saddle cares about power specifically. High-power creatures crew efficiently, while low-power creatures may need to team up. Mount creatures (the typed vehicles) often have bonuses for their riders. When playing saddle, include enough power to crew reliably. One big creature often saddles better than multiple small ones. When playing against saddle, removing their creatures denies them pilots, leaving vehicles as useless artifacts.

#### Spree
**Rules**: Cast by choosing one or more modes, paying their costs.
**Strategy**: Spree spells have multiple modes you can mix and match, paying for each chosen mode. This provides flexibility - a cheap single mode early, or expensive multi-mode bomb late. The base cost is often 0-1 mana, with modes costing 1-3 each. When playing spree, evaluate which modes you need right now versus saving mana. Getting multiple modes is card-efficient but mana-intensive. When playing against spree, recognize these spells scale with available mana. Early game they're limited, late game they're powerful multi-effect plays.

### Bloomburrow

#### Expend
**Rules**: Triggers when you spend N or more mana to cast a spell.
**Strategy**: Expend rewards casting expensive spells - spend 4+ or 8+ mana on a single spell to trigger bonuses. This creates tension with tempo (expensive spells are slow) but rewards going bigger. X-spells let you choose when to trigger expend thresholds. When playing expend, build with a higher curve and mana ramp to reliably hit thresholds. Recognize when hitting expend is worth delaying your spell. When playing against expend, pressure them to cast spells early before they can afford expend bonuses. Their powerful late-game requires surviving to get there.

#### Forage
**Rules**: Exile three cards from graveyard or sacrifice a Food.
**Strategy**: Forage has flexible costs - exile graveyard cards OR sacrifice Food. This rewards both graveyard filling and Food generation. Choose based on what you have available and what's more valuable to keep. When playing forage, include ways to fill your graveyard and/or make Food tokens. Having both options available is ideal. When playing against forage, graveyard hate or killing their Food tokens can deny forage costs. Unlike pure graveyard strategies, Food gives them an alternate payment method.

#### Offspring
**Rules**: Pay extra cost to create 1/1 token copy when creature enters.
**Strategy**: Offspring creates a 1/1 copy of the creature for an extra cost. The token copies abilities, making ETB effects particularly valuable - you get two triggers for one card. The copy being 1/1 means it's fragile but retains non-stat abilities. When playing offspring, prioritize it on creatures with strong ETB effects or static abilities. The extra cost is often worth doubling your value. When playing against offspring, expect double ETB triggers. The 1/1 token dies easily but still carries abilities.

#### Valiant
**Rules**: Triggers whenever creature becomes target of a spell or ability you control for the first time each turn.
**Strategy**: Valiant rewards targeting your own creatures - combat tricks, pump spells, auras, and targeted abilities all trigger it. Build around valiant with cheap targeting effects that provide double value. Each creature can only trigger once per turn. When playing valiant, include multiple cheap ways to target your creatures. Combat tricks that pump AND trigger valiant are highly efficient. When playing against valiant, removing the creature in response to the targeting spell prevents valiant value and two-for-ones them.

### Duskmourn: House of Horror

#### Delirium
**Rules**: Bonus if four+ card types are in your graveyard.
**Strategy**: Delirium rewards graveyard diversity - you need four different card types (creature, instant, sorcery, land, artifact, enchantment, etc.) to enable bonuses. Build around it by including varied card types and ways to fill graveyard. Some cards self-enable (artifact creatures count as two types). When playing delirium, track your graveyard composition. Prioritize milling/discarding types you're missing. When playing against delirium, targeted graveyard exile removing a unique type can shut off their bonuses. One surgical exile may be better than mass graveyard removal.

#### Eerie
**Rules**: Triggers whenever an enchantment you control enters or you fully unlock a Room.
**Strategy**: Eerie rewards enchantment themes and Room cards. Every enchantment you play triggers eerie abilities, and unlocking Room second halves triggers again. Build with high enchantment density and Room cards for repeated triggers. When playing eerie, sequence enchantments to maximize triggers when your eerie creatures are in play. Cheap enchantments enable multiple triggers per turn. When playing against eerie, enchantment removal denies future triggers. Killing eerie creatures before they can accumulate triggers limits their value.

#### Impending
**Rules**: Cast for reduced cost without creature type. Gains time counters, becomes creature when last removed.
**Strategy**: Impending creatures can be cast cheaply as non-creature permanents that become creatures after time counters tick down. This gives you a discount now for a delayed threat. The non-creature form often has abilities. When playing impending, use the discount to deploy ahead of curve, accepting the delay. You can pay full cost to skip the wait if needed. When playing against impending, you have time to prepare before it becomes a creature. Use that time to develop answers rather than wasting removal on the non-creature form.

#### Manifest Dread
**Rules**: Look at top two cards, put one face down as 2/2 creature, other in graveyard.
**Strategy**: Manifest dread provides card selection - look at two, one becomes a 2/2 face-down, one fills graveyard. If you manifest a creature, you can turn it face up for its mana cost. The graveyard card fuels delirium, descended, and other graveyard synergies. When playing manifest dread, choose wisely which card to manifest (likely a creature) and which to bin (fuel for other synergies). When playing against manifest dread, face-down creatures might be anything. They get both a creature and graveyard value.

#### Rooms
**Rules**: Split enchantments. Can cast either door, unlock second door later.
**Strategy**: Rooms are split enchantments - cast one "door" initially, pay to unlock the second door later. This provides flexibility and late-game mana sinks. You get immediate value plus the option for more later. Unlocking doors triggers eerie abilities. When playing rooms, choose the door that best fits your current situation. Save mana for unlocking when you'd otherwise flood. When playing against rooms, enchantment removal denies both doors. Apply pressure to prevent them from leisurely unlocking second doors.

#### Survival
**Rules**: Bonus at beginning of second main phase if this creature is tapped.
**Strategy**: Survival rewards attacking (which taps creatures) with bonuses in second main phase. This encourages aggression - attack to get your survival triggers, then benefit. Vigilance notably anti-synergizes (creature doesn't tap). When playing survival, plan to attack every turn with survival creatures. The bonus in second main means you attack, then get value. When playing against survival, blocking to kill or remove before combat denies survival triggers. If they can't attack safely, survival doesn't trigger.

## Common Deciduous Keywords (appear frequently but not every set)

### Cycling
**Rules**: Pay cost, discard this card: Draw a card.
**Strategy**: Cycling turns dead draws into new cards. A situational card that's bad right now can be cycled for something else. This dramatically increases deck consistency - your cycling cards are never truly dead. Some cards have cycling triggers or reward you when you cycle. When deck building, cycling cards are more flexible than they appear - count them as partial cards of their type. When playing against cycling, you can't disrupt it easily, but cycling costs mana and time. Pressure them so they can't afford to cycle.

### Kicker
**Rules**: Pay optional additional cost for enhanced effect.
**Strategy**: Kicker cards are playable at base cost early or kicked for bonus effects late. This flexibility makes them excellent - never dead early, powerful late. Evaluate kicker cards at both costs: is the base rate acceptable? Is the kicked version worth it? When playing kicker, base cost early to develop, kick later when you have excess mana. The decision point each cast keeps opponents guessing. When playing against kicker, their cards scale with mana. Pressure early before they can afford kicks, or accept that late-game their spells will be enhanced.

### Flashback
**Rules**: Cast from graveyard for flashback cost, then exile.
**Strategy**: Flashback gives spells a second use from the graveyard. This is built-in card advantage - one card, two uses. Flashback costs are typically higher than original costs. Filling your graveyard is valuable when you have flashback cards. When playing flashback, treat it as card advantage engine. Mill and discard effects aren't all downside when you can cast from graveyard. When playing against flashback, graveyard hate is essential. Exiling their graveyard denies second casts. Prioritize removing high-impact flashback spells.

### Landfall
**Rules**: Triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control.
**Strategy**: Landfall rewards playing lands with bonuses each time. Fetchlands trigger twice (play fetch, sacrifice fetch to get land). Effects that put extra lands into play multiply triggers. When building landfall, include fetchlands if legal, extra land drop effects, and ways to replay lands. When playing landfall, sequence lands after playing landfall creatures. When playing against landfall, you can't stop their land drops, but you can remove landfall creatures before they accumulate value. Landfall is inevitable but beatable.

### Convoke
**Rules**: Tap creatures to help pay mana costs.
**Strategy**: Convoke converts creatures into mana. Each tapped creature pays 1 or its color. This rewards going wide with tokens and cheap creatures. A board of five creatures means 5 mana available for convoking. When playing convoke, build wide boards before casting convoke spells. Creatures can convoke the turn they enter (no summoning sickness for tapping). When playing against convoke, board sweepers deny convoke mana by removing creatures. Don't let them establish wide boards unpunished.

### Prowess
**Rules**: Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
**Strategy**: Prowess rewards casting noncreature spells - each one pumps prowess creatures. Build around it with cheap instants and sorceries, especially cantrips (cheap spells that draw cards). Multiple spells in one turn stack prowess triggers. When playing prowess, chain cheap spells on combat turns for massive damage. Combat tricks are especially good - pump from the trick plus prowess trigger. When playing against prowess, remove prowess creatures before they can attack. Track how many spells they could cast to gauge potential damage. Don't assume a small prowess creature stays small.

### Affinity
**Rules**: Costs {1} less for each [permanent type] you control.
**Strategy**: Affinity reduces costs based on permanents you control. Affinity for artifacts is most common - each artifact reduces the cost by 1. This rewards building around the permanent type heavily, potentially casting expensive spells for very cheap. When building affinity, maximize the relevant permanent type. Artifact lands count for artifact affinity. When playing affinity, establish permanents before casting affinity spells for maximum discount. When playing against affinity, removing their permanents increases costs. Don't let them build critical mass of the relevant type.

### Toxic
**Rules**: Deals N poison counters to players it damages (in addition to damage).
**Strategy**: Toxic provides an alternate win condition - 10 poison counters kills regardless of life total. Toxic damage happens alongside regular damage, pressuring both life and poison. This splits your opponent's defensive priorities. When playing toxic, you need enough poison to matter - partial poison is wasted if you're winning through damage anyway. Build dedicated poison strategies. When playing against toxic, recognize that life gain doesn't help against poison. You must block or remove toxic creatures. A deck that poisons you to 9 and deals 1 damage still loses - don't let them reach 10.

## Notes

- **Priority for filling in**: Start with evergreen keywords and bending abilities, as these are most relevant to current Standard strategy.
- **Strategic content should cover**: When the ability is strong, when it's weak, how to play around it, sideboard considerations.
- **This is fine-tuning material**: Focus on teaching reasoning, not just definitions.
